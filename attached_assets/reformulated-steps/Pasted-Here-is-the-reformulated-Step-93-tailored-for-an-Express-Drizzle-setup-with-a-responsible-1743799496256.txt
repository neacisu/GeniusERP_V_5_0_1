Here is the **reformulated Step 93** tailored for an **Express + Drizzle** setup, with a responsible audit-first approach to avoid duplication:

### ðŸ”„ Step 93: Audit & Create Marketing Controller (Express + Drizzle)

**ðŸ“Œ Description:**  
Prepare the foundational `MarketingController` for the GeniusERP v.2 platform, designed to handle marketing campaign logic and future integrations (email marketing, ad channels, campaign analytics, segmentation, etc.). The initial placeholder endpoint (`/campaign-placeholder`) will allow test integrations and UI scaffolding.

The controller must be **secured via authentication**, integrated properly into the Express app, and built to evolve into a highly modular and powerful marketing backend â€” significantly beyond HubSpot-like functionality.

---

### ðŸ§  Agent Instructions:

#### 1. **Audit First**:
- Search for existing files or Express routes related to marketing under:
  - `src/modules/marketing/`
  - `src/routes/marketing.ts`
- If a `marketing.controller.ts` (or similar route) exists:
  - Check if a `/campaign-placeholder` route is already defined.
  - If not, append the route and ensure `requireAuth` middleware is applied.
  - Skip duplication; improve/extend existing file.

#### 2. **If Not Present, Create:**

Create a new Express router at:  
`src/modules/marketing/marketing.controller.ts`

---

### âœ… Example Controller (Express):

```ts
import { Router } from "express";
import { requireAuth } from "../../common/middleware/auth.middleware";

const router = Router();

router.post("/campaign-placeholder", requireAuth, async (req, res) => {
  return res.json({
    message: "Marketing campaign creation placeholder",
    data: req.body,
  });
});

export default router;
```

---

### ðŸ”— Register Route:

**In your main server file or route registrar:**

```ts
import marketingRoutes from "./modules/marketing/marketing.controller";
app.use("/v1/marketing", marketingRoutes);
```

---

### ðŸ§ª Test Endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/marketing/campaign-placeholder \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"campaignName":"Spring Sale 2025"}'
```

---

### ðŸ”’ Notes on Security:

- Always wrap marketing endpoints with `requireAuth` middleware.
- Later, integrate with `RolesGuard` and `@Roles()` to restrict campaign creation to marketing or admin teams.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Outcome:
> A properly registered and secured `/v1/marketing/campaign-placeholder` route within the Express app, ready for expansion into a comprehensive, multi-channel, AI-enhanced marketing engine.
