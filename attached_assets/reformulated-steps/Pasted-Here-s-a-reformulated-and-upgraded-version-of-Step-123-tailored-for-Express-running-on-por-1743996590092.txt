Here’s a **reformulated and upgraded version** of **Step 123** tailored for **Express running on port 5000 with Drizzle**, using the `/api/` base path and enforcing secure access with:

- `AuthGuard.protect(JwtAuthMode.REQUIRED)`
- `AuthGuard.roleGuard()`
- `AuthGuard.companyGuard()`

---

### ✅ Step 123: Test Employee Creation Endpoint

**🎯 Objective:**  
Verify that the `/api/hr/employee` endpoint correctly inserts an employee into the `employee` table, validating the HR module functionality (📘 Section 4.1.4.7).

---

### 🧠 Agent Instructions

#### 🔍 First: Check Before Testing
- Ensure `/api/hr/employee` route is registered (see: `src/modules/hr/hr.controller.ts`)
- Confirm that `EmployeeService.createEmployee()` exists and is injected correctly
- Confirm middleware:
  - `AuthGuard.protect(JwtAuthMode.REQUIRED)`
  - `AuthGuard.roleGuard(["hr_team"])`
  - `AuthGuard.companyGuard()`
- App should be running on **port `5000`**

---

### 🧪 Test Command (via cURL)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/hr/employee \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "companyId": "test-co",
    "franchiseId": "test-franchise",
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "position": "Manager",
    "salary": 50000,
    "hireDate": "2025-03-09"
}'
```

---

### ✅ Expected Results:
- Returns a `200 OK` response with the inserted employee object.
- Employee record is visible in Drizzle/Postgres (via Drizzle Studio or query).
- AuthGuard prevents access without a valid JWT token.
- Only users with role `"hr_team"` can access this route.

### 🛠 Troubleshooting Checklist:
| Checkpoint                            | What to Verify                                  |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Controller registered                | `/api/hr/employee` is mounted in `server.ts`    |
| Auth middleware applied              | `AuthGuard.protect()`, `roleGuard()`, `companyGuard()` used |
| Correct token used                   | Token from Step 78 has `hr_team` in roles       |
| App is running                       | App is listening on port `5000`                 |
| Drizzle migration applied            | `employee` table exists in DB                   |

Let me know if you want to:
- Extend the endpoint to support employee updates
- Add Zod validation for the request body
- Connect this with contract or attendance management logic
