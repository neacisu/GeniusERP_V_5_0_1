### ðŸ”„ Step 92: Audit & Create Ecommerce Controller (Express + Drizzle)

**ðŸ“Œ Description:**  
Establish or upgrade the `EcommerceController` in GeniusERP v.2 to support e-commerce and POS operations. This controller will initially expose a placeholder endpoint (e.g., order creation stub), secured via authentication middleware, and will serve as the foundation for future expansion â€” including order processing, Shopify integrations, payment gateways, and POS flows.

---

### ðŸ§  Agent Instructions:

1. **Audit First:**
   - Search the codebase for any existing Express route handlers under:
     - `src/modules/ecommerce/`
     - `src/routes/ecommerce.ts`
     - Look for `/ecommerce` route paths in the main app router or registered modules.
   - If an `ecommerce.controller.ts` or similar logic is found, **enhance it** with a `POST /order-placeholder` endpoint secured by auth middleware.
   - Avoid duplicate declarations or route conflicts.

2. **If Not Present, Create:**
   - Create a new controller file: `src/modules/ecommerce/ecommerce.controller.ts`
   - Implement a secured route using `requireAuth` middleware
   - Register the route under `/v1/ecommerce` in the main Express app router

---

### âœ… Example (Express Controller):

```ts
import { Router } from "express";
import { requireAuth } from "../../common/middleware/auth.middleware";

const router = Router();

router.post("/order-placeholder", requireAuth, async (req, res) => {
  return res.json({
    message: "E-commerce order creation placeholder",
    data: req.body,
  });
});

export default router;
```

---

### ðŸ”— Integration:

- **In your Express app entry:**

```ts
import ecommerceRoutes from "./modules/ecommerce/ecommerce.controller";
app.use("/v1/ecommerce", ecommerceRoutes);
```

- **Ensure export from module index:**

```ts
export { default as ecommerceRoutes } from "./ecommerce.controller";
```

---

### ðŸ”’ Security:

Ensure all routes use `requireAuth` middleware to enforce JWT-based access control as implemented in the Auth module.

---

### ðŸ§ª Test Command:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/ecommerce/order-placeholder \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"productId":"test-product","qty":1}'
```

---

### âœ… Outcome:
> An initial `EcommerceController` with secure placeholder logic is operational and integrated in a modular fashion, ready for expansion with real-world order creation, Shopify sync, payment processing, and POS logic.

```
