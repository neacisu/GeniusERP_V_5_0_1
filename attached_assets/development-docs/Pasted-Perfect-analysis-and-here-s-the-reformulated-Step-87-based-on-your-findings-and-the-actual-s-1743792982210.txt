### ✅ Step 87: Audit & Enhance Existing BullMQ Integration (Express + Drizzle)

**📌 Description:**  
A complete BullMQ system is already implemented in GeniusERP v.2, including RedisService, QueueService, and usage in Inventory workflows. This step ensures that integration is fully documented, configured with `.env`, and optionally modularized for maintainability (Section 4.1.1.2.5).

---

### 🔍 Agent Task

Please **audit** and, if needed, **enhance** the existing BullMQ integration using the following checklist:

---

### ✅ What Already Exists:

- `server/services/redis.service.ts` — Robust RedisService with failover and Redis Cloud compatibility
- `server/services/queue.service.ts` — Queues: `balanceQueue`, `stockQueue`, `reportQueue` (using BullMQ)
- `server/modules/inventory/services/check-stock-levels.service.ts` — Proper low-stock alerting with queue
- `server/monkey-patch.ts` — Suppresses Redis eviction warnings
- Queue jobs and workers registered with fallback if Redis is down

---

### 🟡 What’s Missing or Needs Improvement:

1. **.env File:**
   Add Redis connection details if not already present.

   ```
   REDIS_HOST=localhost
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   REDIS_PASSWORD=optional
   ```

2. **Unify Queue Naming Convention:**
   - Rename `stockQueue` to `inventoryQueue` if consistency is needed across modules.

3. **Organize BullMQ Codebase (Optional but Recommended):**
   - Create `server/common/bullmq/` directory with:
     - `queues.ts` → export all queues in a single place
     - `worker.ts` → centralized job handlers (optional)
     - `types.ts` → define BullMQ job payload types

4. **Docs + Logs:**
   - Add in-code documentation on all queue jobs
   - Add `console.log()` or structured logs for every queued job and worker event (e.g., `job completed`, `job failed`)

---

### 🧪 Verification:

- Run `npm start`
- Confirm Redis connects cleanly
- Trigger low-stock event → confirm job is added and processed
- Log shows proper job lifecycle

---

### 🏁 Outcome:

> A fully working, production-grade BullMQ system powered by Redis, cleanly integrated into the inventory module — now with environment variables, unified structure, and documentation.

No need to rewrite — just reinforce and organize what’s already robust. 🚀
