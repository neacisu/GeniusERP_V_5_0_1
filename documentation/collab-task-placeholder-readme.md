# Collaboration Module - Task Placeholder

## Overview
The Collaboration module provides internal team collaboration capabilities including task management, notes, internal discussions, assignment tracking, and status monitoring. This implementation adds a new `task-placeholder` endpoint as a foundation for future functionality.

## Features
- Secure endpoint protected by JWT authentication
- Minimal task creation with assignment capability
- Support for task workflow tracking
- Foundation for future collaboration features

## API Endpoints

### Task Placeholder
```
POST /api/collaboration/tasks/task-placeholder
```

**Authorization:** Bearer Token (JWT)

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "title": "Task Title",
  "description": "Task description",
  "assigned_to": "user123",
  "priority": "high"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Collaboration task creation placeholder",
  "timestamp": "2023-01-01T12:34:56.789Z",
  "requestData": {
    "title": "Task Title",
    "description": "Task description",
    "assigned_to": "user123",
    "priority": "high"
  },
  "context": {
    "userId": "7e9c1d11-bb91-4e1a-b8f2-be336b16a56c",
    "companyId": "c23e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
  }
}
```

## Testing
You can test the endpoint using the provided test script:

```
npx tsx test-collab-task-placeholder.ts
```

This script creates a JWT token with test user credentials and makes a POST request to the task-placeholder endpoint.

## Implementation Details
- The endpoint is implemented in `server/modules/collab/routes/task.routes.ts`
- Authentication is handled via `AuthGuard.requireAuth()` middleware
- The Collaboration module is initialized in `server/modules/index.ts`

## Future Enhancements
1. Extend with comprehensive task management features
2. Add support for user notifications on task assignments
3. Implement supervisor approvals workflow
4. Add task notes and comments functionality
5. Enable task dependencies and related tasks tracking
