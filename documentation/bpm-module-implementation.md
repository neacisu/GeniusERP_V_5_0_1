# BPM Module Implementation

## Overview
We have successfully implemented the Business Process Management (BPM) module in the GeniusERP v.2 system. This module provides a foundation for automating business processes, workflow management, and integrations with other modules.

## Implemented Components

### BPM Module Structure
- **Singleton Pattern**: Implemented as a singleton to ensure a single instance across the application
- **Services**: Process service for handling business process definitions and executions
- **Routes**: Dedicated API endpoints for BPM functionality with proper authentication

### Key Features
- **Process Management**: Placeholder endpoint for process creation and management
- **Authentication**: Secured all endpoints with proper JWT authentication
- **Audit Logging**: All actions are tracked in the audit log system
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Endpoints respect the RBAC system

### Integration with Core System
- Successfully registered the BPM module in the application's module system
- Proper initialization and route registration
- Error handling for graceful failure recovery

## API Endpoints

### `POST /api/bpm/process-placeholder`
Placeholder endpoint for processing BPM-related requests.

**Request Headers:**
- `Authorization`: Bearer token (JWT)

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "name": "Process Name",
  "description": "Process Description",
  "companyId": "company-uuid"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "BPM process definition placeholder",
  "data": {
    "requestData": {
      "name": "Process Name",
      "description": "Process Description",
      "companyId": "company-uuid"
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-04-04T21:20:07.093Z"
  }
}
```

## Testing
Created a test script (`test-bpm-process-endpoint.ts`) that demonstrates:
- Generating a valid JWT token with appropriate roles
- Making an API request to the process placeholder endpoint
- Receiving and validating the response

## Future Expansion
The BPM module is designed for easy expansion with:
- Process definition storage
- Process execution tracking
- Integration with other modules (Inventory, CRM, etc.)
- Custom step templates for various business processes
- Automation triggers and scheduled jobs

## Notes
- The module follows the same architecture pattern as other modules in the system
- Audit logging is properly implemented for all actions
- All routes are protected with authentication middleware
