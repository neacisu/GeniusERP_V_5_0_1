# CRM Module Improvements Report

## Summary

This report documents the improvements made to the CRM module, particularly focusing on the ActivityController, ActivityService, and related components. The enhancements were designed to fix inconsistencies between code and database structures, improve the architecture, and ensure proper filtering capabilities.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Field Name Alignment

Field names in the service and controller have been aligned with the database table structure:

| Code (Before) | Database | Code (After) |
|--------------|----------|--------------|
| `customerId` | `client_company_id` | `clientCompanyId` |
| `type` | `activity_type` | `activityType` |
| `scheduledDate` | `start_time` | `startTime` |
| `completedDate` | `end_time` | `endTime` |

### 2. Query Parameter Handling

- Fixed the handling of query parameters in `ActivityController` to properly map to their database counterparts
- Added support for filtering activities by `activityType` instead of `type`
- Ensured proper date range filtering using `startTime` instead of `scheduledDate`

### 3. Schema Improvements

- Updated the ActivityRelations in the CRM schema to correctly reflect the database structure
- Fixed the relation between activities and client companies using `clientCompanyId` and the `crm_companies` table

### 4. Testing and Validation

- Created test scripts to validate the endpoint functionality
- Verified filtering capabilities work as expected
- Confirmed proper results are returned from database queries

## Implementation Details

### Controller Changes

```typescript
// Before
const type = query.type as string;

// After
const type = query.activityType as string;
```

### Service Changes

```typescript
// Before
if (customerId) {
  conditions.push(eq(activities.customerId, customerId));
}

// After
if (customerId) {
  conditions.push(eq(activities.clientCompanyId, customerId));
}
```

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully, demonstrating that:

1. Activities can be retrieved correctly
2. Filtering by activity type works as expected
3. Date range filtering functions properly
4. Relations between activities and related entities (deals, contacts, client companies) work correctly

## Conclusion

The CRM module improvements have successfully aligned the code with the database structure while maintaining the same functionality. The changes ensure that:

1. The API can effectively filter and query activities
2. The code remains compatible with the existing database schema
3. The system accurately represents relationships between different entities

These changes enhance the maintainability and reliability of the CRM module while preparing it for future expansions.
