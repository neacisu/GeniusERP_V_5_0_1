# Server Controllers

This directory contains controller files that manage the application's API endpoints and route handling.

## Files:

- **analytics.controller.tmp.ts** - Controller for analytics functionality
- **predictive.controller.updated.ts** - Controller for predictive analytics functionality

## Purpose:

Controllers handle HTTP requests, interact with services to perform operations, and return appropriate responses to clients. They implement the routing logic and apply middleware for authentication and authorization.
