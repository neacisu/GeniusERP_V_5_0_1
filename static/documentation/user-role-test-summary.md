# User Role Testing Summary Report

## Available Test Users

We have successfully created and tested the following user accounts with different roles:

| Username    | Password    | Role        | Access Level                     |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| admin       | admin       | admin       | Full system access               |
| contabil    | contabil    | accountant  | Accounting module access         |
| vanzari     | vanzari     | sales       | Sales module access             |
| marketing   | marketing   | marketing   | Marketing module access          |
| gestionar   | gestionar   | inventory   | Inventory module access          |

## Authentication Tests

✅ All user accounts were successfully created or verified in the database.
✅ Each user can authenticate properly with their username and password.
✅ JWT tokens are generated correctly with appropriate user claims.
✅ All authenticated users can access common endpoints.

## Role-Based Access Control Tests

We verified that RBAC is working correctly across different endpoints:

### Admin-Only Access
- `/api/auth/users` - Only accessible by the admin user; others receive 403 Forbidden.

### Universal Access (All Authenticated Users)
- `/api/auth/user` - Accessible by all roles, returns user profile information.
- `/api/auth/verify` - Accessible by all roles, verifies authentication.

## Security Implementation Details

1. Authentication is handled via JWT tokens.
2. User roles are embedded in the JWT payload.
3. The AuthGuard middleware properly validates tokens and enforces role restrictions.
4. Failed authentication attempts result in appropriate status codes (401/403).

## Database Verification

The users table in the database contains all test users with their correct roles:
- The admin user has role: "admin"
- The contabil user has role: "accountant"
- The vanzari user has role: "sales" 
- The marketing user has role: "marketing"
- The gestionar user has role: "inventory"

## Next Steps

1. Implement more granular permission checks for specific module functionality.
2. Add role-based UI elements that show/hide based on the user's permissions.
3. Implement audit logging for authentication and authorization events.

**Test Completed Successfully:** All users can authenticate and access appropriate resources based on their roles.
