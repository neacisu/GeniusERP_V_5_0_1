# Authentication Standardization Report - Inventory Module

## Summary of Changes

The Inventory module was successfully updated to use the standardized authentication pattern, replacing deprecated methods with the canonical authentication pattern. The inventory module now uses the static class methods from AuthGuard and the proper JwtAuthMode enumeration from the centralized location.

### Modified Files:
- `server/modules/inventory/controllers/inventory.controller.ts` - Updated with standardized auth pattern

### Pattern Replacements:
- Replaced `AuthGuard.AuthGuard.protect(JwtAuthMode.REQUIRED)` with `AuthGuard.protect(JwtAuthMode.REQUIRED)`
- Replaced `AuthGuard.requireRoles(INVENTORY_ROLES)` with `AuthGuard.roleGuard(INVENTORY_ROLES)`
- Added proper import for `UserRole` from `../../auth/types`

### Testing:
- Updated test-inventory-api-endpoints.ts to use the correct port (5000)
- Fixed JWT signature issue by using default import for jsonwebtoken
- Successfully tested all inventory endpoints:
  - POST /api/inventory/check-stock-levels
  - GET /api/inventory/stock/approaching-threshold
  - POST /api/inventory/schedule-stock-checks

## Next Steps
The authentication standardization should be extended to other modules following the same pattern:
1. Update imports to use the static class pattern
2. Replace instance-based methods with static methods
3. Run tests to verify functionality
4. Document changes in the standardization report

## Benefits
- Improved consistency across the codebase
- Better security through standardized auth pattern
- Simplified maintenance with centralized auth logic
- Cleaner code with static method approach instead of instance-based approach
