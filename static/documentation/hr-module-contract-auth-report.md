# HR Module Contract Endpoints Authentication Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the improvements made to the HR module contract endpoints to ensure proper authentication and authorization.

## Changes Implemented

All contract-related endpoints in the HR module have been secured with appropriate authentication middleware:

1. **GET /api/hr/contracts/:employeeId** - Retrieves contract history for an employee
   - Added `AuthGuard.roleGuard(['hr_team', 'admin'])` - Restricts access to HR team and admin users
   - Added `AuthGuard.companyGuard('companyId')` - Ensures users can only access data from their own company

2. **POST /api/hr/contracts** - Creates a new employment contract
   - Endpoint was already protected with proper authentication
   - Validation confirmed working properly

3. **PUT /api/hr/contracts/:id** - Updates an existing employment contract
   - Added `AuthGuard.roleGuard(['hr_team', 'admin'])` - Restricts access to HR team and admin users
   - Added `AuthGuard.companyGuard('companyId')` - Ensures users can only access data from their own company

## Verification

A comprehensive test script (`test-contract-auth.js`) was created to verify that authentication works correctly on all contract endpoints. The test results confirmed:

- Requests without authentication (no token) receive 401 Unauthorized
- Requests with insufficient permissions (wrong role) receive 403 Forbidden
- Requests with proper authentication proceed to business logic validation

## Security Model

The HR module's contract endpoints now follow the established security pattern:

```typescript
router.get('/endpoint', 
  AuthGuard.roleGuard(['hr_team', 'admin']),      // Role-based access control
  AuthGuard.companyGuard('companyId'),            // Company data isolation
  async (req: AuthenticatedRequest, res: Response) => {
    // Endpoint implementation
  }
);
```

This pattern ensures:
1. Only authenticated users can access these endpoints
2. Users must have the appropriate role (hr_team or admin)
3. Users can only access data from their own company

## Next Steps

- Apply similar authentication patterns to other HR endpoints that may still be missing proper authentication
- Consider implementing more granular permission checks for specific contract operations
