# Communications Module - Unified Messaging System

## Overview

The Communications Module provides a unified inbox and messaging system that integrates various communication channels (email, WhatsApp, SMS, social media, etc.) into a single, coherent interface. This module enables businesses to manage all their customer communication from one place, regardless of the channel.

## Key Features

- **Universal Inbox**: Consolidate messages from multiple channels into a single interface
- **Conversation Threading**: Group related messages into conversations/threads
- **Channel Integration**: Connect to various communication platforms via API
- **Contact Management**: Track communication contacts across different channels
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Control who can view and respond to specific messages
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Track the emotional tone of customer communications
- **Message Flagging**: Mark important messages for follow-up
- **Search Functionality**: Find messages across all channels based on content or metadata

## Core Components

### Thread Management

Messages are organized into threads (conversations) that can span multiple channels. Each thread contains a series of chronological messages and maintains metadata about the conversation's status, assignment, and related entities.

### Message Handling

The system processes messages from different channels with consistent formatting while preserving channel-specific capabilities. All messages are stored with rich metadata including sender/recipient information, timestamps, and sentiment analysis.

### Contact Management

The module maintains a unified contact database that connects identities across different channels, enabling a complete view of all communications with a specific contact, regardless of channel.

### Channel Configuration

Administrators can configure various communication channels by providing API credentials, webhook URLs, and channel-specific settings. The system supports enablement/disablement of channels and channel-specific notifications.
