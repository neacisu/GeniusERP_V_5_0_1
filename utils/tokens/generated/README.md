# Generated Tokens Directory

This directory contains tokens generated by the token manager and various token scripts.

## Usage

Tokens generated here are typically used for testing, development, and example purposes. They should not be committed to version control if they contain sensitive information.

## Directory Structure

- Root directory contains actively used tokens
- **archive/** - Older or redundant tokens maintained for reference

## Token Lifecycle

Generated tokens should follow this lifecycle:

1. **Creation**: Generated using the token manager CLI or token scripts
2. **Usage**: Used for testing, demos, or development
3. **Archiving**: Moved to the archive directory when no longer needed
4. **Deletion**: Deleted when completely obsolete

## Naming Conventions

Token files should follow these naming conventions:

- **admin-token.txt** - General admin token
- **user-{role}-token.txt** - User token with specific role
- **module-{module}-token.txt** - Module-specific token
- **demo-{purpose}-token.txt** - Demo/example token

## Security Considerations

- Generated tokens may contain sensitive information
- Avoid committing tokens with long expiration times to version control
- Use short expiration times (< 1 hour) for example and demo tokens
- Consider adding .gitignore patterns to prevent accidentally committing tokens
