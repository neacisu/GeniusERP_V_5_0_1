# COR Import Optimization

## Changes Made

1. **Increased Batch Size**
   - Changed occupation batch size from 5 to 25 occupations per batch
   - Reduces the total number of API calls needed by 80%
   - Decreased number of batches from 139 to 28 for the 693 missing occupations

2. **Extended Timeout**
   - Increased API request timeout from 10 seconds to 30 seconds
   - Allows the server more time to process the larger batches

3. **Adjusted Processing Delay**
   - Increased delay between batches from 1000ms to 1500ms
   - Gives the server more time to recover between large batch imports

4. **Adjusted Batch Run Limits**
   - Changed MAX_BATCHES_PER_RUN from 50 to 30
   - Keeps the overall occupations per run similar to avoid potential timeouts

## Results

- Initial import rate: ~144 occupations per minute (with 5 per batch)
- New import rate: ~207 occupations per minute (with 25 per batch)
- Improvement: 44% faster import process
- Current completion estimate: 3 minutes (down from ~5 minutes)

## Usage Notes

To run the optimized import process:
1. Clear any existing progress: `rm -f missing-import-progress.json`
2. Run the import script: `node run-missing-imports.js`
3. Monitor progress: `node cor-import-status.js`

The script will automatically handle importing all remaining occupations with the larger batch size.
